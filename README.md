# Time-Series-Analysis

This repository explores time series forecasting techniques for a dataset spanning July 2020 to May 2021. Our objective is to predict values for June 2021. We'll compare the performance of popular approaches:

Linear Regression: A fundamental statistical method for establishing a linear relationship between variables. It's well-suited for capturing linear trends but might struggle with complex patterns.

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): A type of neural network designed to handle sequential data like time series. RNNs can learn temporal dependencies but can be susceptible to the vanishing gradient problem.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Another RNN variant explicitly designed to address vanishing gradients. LSTMs employ memory cells to learn long-term dependencies, making them powerful for capturing complex temporal dynamics.
